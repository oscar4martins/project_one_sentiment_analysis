# This study measured the relationship between Twitter Sentiment and the United Airline stock prices. 

Problem Statement: To determine the effect of twitter sentiments on stock prices

The tweets were analysed using Vader Sentiment analysis in python 

I used the beautiful soup library in python to scrap over 3,000,000 tweets from the United Airlines twitter page. 

I performed a Vader Sentiments analysis to generate compound scores for the tweets ranging from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017. 

My findings showed a very weak correlation between the two variables.
